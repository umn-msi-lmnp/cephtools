## SYNOPSIS

`cephtools bucketpolicy [--subcommand-options]`

## DESCRIPTION

`cephtools bucketpolicy` is a bash script that facilitates creating and setting bucket policies on *ceph*. It has only a few options and is fairly strict in functionality.

1. bucket_policy.json
2. bucket_policy_readme.md
